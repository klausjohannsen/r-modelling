# r-modelling
This software attempts to model relationships from a relationship matrix. For the time being the a relationship is given by any symmetric (numerical) nxn-matrix R. Aim  is to find n vectors xi, i = 1 ...n and a function f such that Rij = f(xi, xj). The relationship btw two vectors xi and xj may be unknown, represented as a masked value in the R matrix.
